# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- Responsive Design

## Plan on improving the project

This project was desingned with a responsive layout in mind. That being said there are ways to make the transitions even smoother. The profile information layout also looks like it has room for improvement in the tablet view specifically. The project could also be greatly improved by adding functionality to the buttons. For example, if you were able to click the edit button and make changes to the information, that would be a huge improvement.
